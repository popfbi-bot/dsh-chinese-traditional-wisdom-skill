> **Traditional-culture reference, not absolute prediction.** This Skill provides structured calculations, cultural interpretation, and constructive suggestions. It is not medical diagnosis, treatment, financial advice, or a guarantee of real-world outcomes.

## What It Is

Chinese Traditional Wisdom Skill is a local-first Skill for traditional-culture consultation. It turns a question into suitable inputs, uses deterministic local engines to generate reviewable charts, dates, GanZhi data, and rule results, then keeps those results separate from cultural interpretation and practical, cautious suggestions.

```text
Your question
  → Choose a traditional-culture context
  → Local engine calculates reviewable facts
  → Cultural interpretation and constructive suggestions
  → Clear limits, disclaimer, and next steps
```

- **Local-first** — Core calculations run locally; full birth details do not need to be sent to a remote service.
- **No model guessing** — Charts, GanZhi data, values, mappings, and rule matching come from local engines; the model must not infer or fill in deterministic facts.
- **Layered results** — Local facts, cultural interpretation, and practical suggestions are presented separately.
- **Flexible access** — Use the Dashboard directly or invoke it through an AI Agent that supports local Skills.

## What It Does

| Your goal | Traditional-culture context | What you receive |
|---|---|---|
| Understand the Four Pillars associated with a birth time | BaZi, favorable elements, ShenSha, annual cycles, and the dynamic layer | Four Pillars, Five Elements, Ten Gods, decadal/minor fortune, and annual, monthly, and daily pillars for a selected date |
| Reflect on life themes through Ziwei | Ziwei Doushu | Palace, star, and structured-chart information |
| Organize thinking about a specific question through divination | Liuyao, Meihua Yishu, Qimen Dunjia, Daliuren, Taiyi, character divination | Cast or chart results, reviewable rule facts, and bounded cultural interpretation |
| Select dates or plan everyday rhythms | Almanac, date selection, Xingxiu, rhythms, Five Movements and Six Qi | Date data, suitability reference, and seasonal cultural context |
| Explore a traditional perspective on a living space | Flying Stars, Eight Mansions, form and direction reference | Local mappings and rule results for space organization reference |
| Explore constitution tendencies or wellness cultivation | Constitution questionnaire, Five Movements and Six Qi, wellness combinations | Cultural reference and lifestyle suggestions; consult a physician first for symptoms or disease concerns |
| Discuss names, dreams, relationships, or life choices | Name analysis, dream interpretation, marriage compatibility, annual/monthly combinations | Structured reference information and a non-fatalistic discussion framework |

### Complete Dashboard feature directory

The Dashboard also includes global birth-data management, true-solar-time verification/civil-time fallback status, Command Palette navigation, page-summary copying, structured report export, and local history recording.

> **About the counts:** The 24 Dashboard workspaces are user-facing page entry points. The repository also contains **32 local CLI tools**, including true-solar-time preprocessing, underlying charting/daily calculations, constitution questionnaires, and multiple combined analyses. A CLI tool can map to one or more Dashboard functions. See [tool-index.md](tool-index.md) for exact names, input contracts, and runnable fixtures.

## Get Started

### Option 1: Use the Dashboard

Best for browsing charts, adjusting inputs, and viewing results visually.

```bash
cd apps/visual
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm dev
```

The project pins dependencies through Node `24.12.x`, pnpm `10.26.1`, and `pnpm-lock.yaml`; do not generate or commit `package-lock.json`. Open the local URL, select a page, and provide the required information. The Dashboard uses local TypeScript engines. Labels such as `local-exact`, `local-approx`, folk experience, demo, or fallback disclose the calculation mode and availability.

### Option 2: Use Through an AI Agent

Install or load this repository as a local Skill, then have the Agent read [SKILL.md](SKILL.md) and [RULES.md](RULES.md). The Agent must:

1. Understand your question, context, and missing inputs; ask rather than guess.
2. Use local tools for deterministic facts; never present model memory or reference text as a calculation from this request.
3. Keep calculation facts, cultural interpretation, practical suggestions, and disclaimers distinct.

See [README_AI.md](README_AI.md) for the complete Agent invocation contract.

## Information to Prepare

Each context requires different information. Share only what is relevant. If a field is uncertain, say so rather than guessing it.

| Context | Usually required | Before you use it |
|---|---|---|
| Birth charts, such as BaZi, Ziwei, and marriage compatibility | Gregorian birth date, hour/minute, gender, and sometimes birthplace | Birth time affects the result. If unknown, preserve that limitation explicitly. |
| True-solar-time verification | Birth record; verified longitude, IANA time zone, UTC offset on the birth date, DST status, and `utcOffsetEvidence` | Without reliable verification, use civil time only and disclose that true solar time has not been verified. |
| Divination | A clear question, casting/chart time, or a stated method | Focus on one describable question; do not replace real decision processes with divination. |
| Fengshui and spaces | Orientation, construction/move-in year, and space information or photo description | Do not replace building safety, fire safety, legal, or professional renovation advice. |
| Constitution and wellness cultivation | Questionnaire responses, habits, and self-reported feelings | Consult a clinician first for symptoms, illness, medication questions, or acute discomfort. |

### True Solar Time

Civil birth time is not automatically true solar time. This Skill provides `resolve_true_solar_time` as a local correction entry point, but a result may be labeled true solar time only when location and historical time-zone evidence have been verified externally. The tool returns `trueSolarBirth` and `trueSolarResolution` for a verified follow-up BaZi calculation.

When reliable verification is unavailable, civil time may be used with informed consent through `timeBasis: 'civil-unverified'` and `civilFallbackConfirmed: true`. The output must state that true solar time has not been verified and must not be described as a true-solar-time result.

## Understanding Results

Read each result in three layers:

1. **Local calculation facts** — Four Pillars, dates, GanZhi data, palaces, mappings, values, and rule relationships from this local-engine invocation.
2. **Traditional-cultural interpretation** — Meanings, symbols, and perspectives used by different traditions. These are cultural reference, not objective prediction.
3. **Practical suggestions** — Communication, record keeping, rest, professional support, or reassessing choices. These should stay constructive and non-fatalistic; you decide whether to adopt them.

### BaZi Dynamic Layer

To view decadal fortune, minor fortune, annual, monthly, or daily pillars for a selected date, use the existing `bazi_calculate` tool with a strict `transitDate: "YYYY-MM-DD"`. The result remains a `ToolEnvelope`; dynamic facts are in `ToolEnvelope.data.transit`.

Minor fortune uses nominal age. `minor.source: "lunar-exact"` means that it comes from the local calendar sequence; `local-fallback` means a deterministic local fallback was used and must be disclosed. GanZhi relations describe only reviewable rule facts; they do not directly establish career, romance, health, wealth, or any other real-world conclusion.

See [bootstrap/bazi-engine.md](bootstrap/bazi-engine.md) for dynamic-layer inputs, outputs, and claims.

## Boundaries and Privacy

- Do not treat traditional-culture results as absolute prediction or as a substitute for personal judgment, legal advice, financial advice, or medical services.
- For symptoms, acute discomfort, or persistent health concerns, seek medical care first. This Skill does not provide diagnosis, prescriptions, or replacement treatment.
- Do not store full birth details, precise locations, or identifying information in long-term logs, public examples, or commits.
- Preserve limitations for uncertain, incomplete, or unverifiable inputs. Never present approximate, demo, or civil-time results as exact results.

See [RULES.md](RULES.md) for the complete ethical and safety rules.

## Advanced Use

### Local CLI

Developers and CLI-capable Agents can invoke local tools directly:

```bash
cd apps/visual
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm engine <tool> <input-json-file>
pnpm engine:iching-lookup src/__fixtures__/analysis/iching-lookup.success.json
```

Except for `resolve_true_solar_time`, which returns `TrueSolarTimeResolution` directly, the CLI returns JSON `ToolEnvelope`. Before presenting deterministic facts, extract structured claims only from the current `ToolEnvelope.data` and verify them with the matching local `validate*Claims(data, claims)` function. This does not validate free-form text, cultural interpretation, suggestions, or prediction.

See [tool-index.md](tool-index.md) for standard success fixtures, all tool names, and CLI examples.

### Development Verification

After changing engines, input contracts, or public documentation, run these commands in `apps/visual`:

```bash
node scripts/check-doc-contracts.mjs
npm run test:unit
npm run typecheck
npm run build
```

The documentation-contract check keeps public tool lists, CLI behavior, fixtures, and key usage contracts synchronized.
